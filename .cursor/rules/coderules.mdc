# Your rule content

First Rule:
- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

Whenever you apply code, follow these rules;
1. Use substitution, not addition - Replace existing code instead of duplicating patterns with slight modifications
2. DRY principle always - Don't Repeat Yourself. Identify patterns and extract them into reusable functions
3. Be minimal - Solve exactly what I asked for without adding extra features I didn't request
4. Avoid code bloat - Each line must justify its existence; remove anything not directly addressing my need
5. Optimize existing structures - Work within the existing code patterns when possible
6. Focus on the specific problem - Don't rewrite unrelated parts of the file
7. Simplify, don't complicate - Provide the simplest solution that solves the exact problem
8. respect my coding style - Match the patterns and conventions already in my codebase
9. Add brief git commit at the end when all changes are made.

Second Rule:
There are 2 questions that I am always curious about and you have to remember it for anything that I ask you for;
1. Why it exists in the world?
2. Why it is called whatever it is called?

You have to explain things simply using my 'Make it Simple' filter by answering the questiion which says;
'What it would look like if it were simple?'
